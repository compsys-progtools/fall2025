1. Read today's notes when they are posted.
2. Most real projects partly adhere and at least partly deviate from any major design philosophy or paradigm. Review the open source project you looked at for the `software.md` file from before and decide if it more adheres to or deviates from the unix philosophy. Add a `## Unix Philosophy <Adherance/Deviation>` section to your {index}`software.md`, setting the title to indicate your decision and explain your decision in that section. Provide at least two specific examples, using links to specific lines of code or specific sections in the documentation that support your claims. 
3. create {index}`methods.md` and answer the following:

```
- Reflecting on your own programming practice, is initial understanding of concepts or debugging later more challenging for you? and why? Your answer here will be "your chosen context" for the rest of the questions. 
- which of the three methods for studying a system do you use most often in your chosen context? Give an example, like an anectdote of learnign something new or a tricky bug you solved. 
- do you think using a different strategy might help you in your chosen context sometimes? why or why not?
