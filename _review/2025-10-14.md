1. Review the notes from today
1. Analyze the xor hashing algorithm in the notes to determine which properties of a cryptographic hash are/not met. Include your analysis in {index}`xorhash.md`
2. find 2 more real world examples of using other number systems (either different bases or different symbols and bases) **not mentioned in class** that are currently used. Describe the number system and its usage in {index}`numbers.md`. Include links to your sources and be sure that the sources are trustworthy. 
3. Calculate the maximum number of git objects that a repo can have without requiring you to use more than the minimum number of characters to refer to any object and include that number in  {index}`gitcounts.md`  with a title `# Git counts`. How many commits would you be able to make before you have to use more than the minimum number of characters to refer to any git object if each commit added a new folder with 1021 files in it? *If you get stuck, outline what you know and then request a review.*
