1.  Export your git log for your KWL main branch to a file called {index}`gitlog.txt` and commit that as exported to the branch for this issue. **note that you will need to work between two branchse to make this happen**. Append a blank line,  `## Commands`, and another blank line to the file, then the command history used for this exercise to the end of the file. 
2.  In {index}`commit-def.md` compare two of the four ways we described a commit today in class. How do the two descriptions differ? How does defining it in different ways help add up to improve your understanding? 
3. Find the detailed view of the commit that added today's notes to the website in github.com and locally.  In `commit-detail.md` include the url to the commit in github and the contents of the commit object with some notes on any differences (if any).
