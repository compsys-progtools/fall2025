1. Review the notes from today
1. On Seawulf, modfiy {index}`main.c` from class to accept the integer as a command line argument instead of via input while running the program. [See this tutorial for an example](http://crasseux.com/books/ctutorial/argc-and-argv.html). 
2. Write a bash script {index}`demo_test.sh` that runs your compiled program for each integer from 10 to 30 (syntax for a range is `{start..end}` so this would be `{10..30}`)
3. Write an sbatch script, {index}`batchrun.sh` to run your script  on a compute node and save the output to a file. The sbatch script should compile and link the program and then call the script. [see the options](https://web.uri.edu/hpc-research-computing/using-seawulf/#sbatch)
4. use [scp](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/comp/security/scp_man.html) to download your modified main, script files, and output to your local computer and include them in your kwl repo. 
5. Create some variations of the `hello.c` we made in class. Make {index}`hello2.c` print twice with 2 print commands. Make {index}`hello5.c` print 5 times with a for loop and {index}`hello7.c` print 7 times with a for loop. Build them all on the command line and make sure they run correctly. 
6. Write a bash script, {index}`assembly.sh` to compile each program to assembly and print the number of lines in each file.  
7. Put the output of your script in {index}`hello_assembly_compare.md`. Add to the file some notes on how they are similar or different based on your own reading of them.
