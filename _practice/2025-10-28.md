1. Review the notes from today
2. configure [ssh keys for your github account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
3. Find 2 other encyrption algorithms that could be used wiht ssh (hint: try `man ssh` or [read it online](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ssh.1.html)) and compare them in {index}`encyryption_compare`.  Your comparison should be enough to advise someone which is best and why, but need not get into the details. 
4. Read through this [rsa encryption demo site](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~kirk/cs1501/notes/rsademo/) site and use it to show what, for a particular public/private key pair (based on small primes) it would look like to pass a message, "It is spring now!" encrypted.  (that is encypt it, and decrypt it with the site, show it's encrypted version and the key pair and describe what would go where). Put your example in {index}`rsademo.md`.
