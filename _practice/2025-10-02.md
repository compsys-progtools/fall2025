1. Review the notes, [jupyterbook docs](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html), and experiment with the `jupyter-book` CLI to determine what files are required to make `jupyter-book build` run in your kwl repo. Make your kwl repo into a jupyter book, by manually adding those files. **Do not add the whole template to your repo**, make the content you have already so it can *build* into html. Set it so that the `_build` directory is not under version control. 
2. Add `docs.md` to your KWL repo and explain the most important things to know about documentation in your own words using other programming concepts you have learned so far.  Include in a markdown (same as HTML `<!-- comment -->` ) comment the list of CSC courses you have taken for context while we give you feedback.1. Review the notes from today

2. Learn about the documentation ecosystem in another language that you know using at least one official source and additional sources as you find helpful. In `docs.md` include a summary of your findings and compare and contrast it to jupyter book/sphinx.  Include a [bibtex based bibliography](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/citations.html) of the sources you used. You can use [this generator](https://url-to-bibtex.vercel.app/) for informal sources and [google scholar](https://digitalmeasures.oregonstate.edu/training/export-bibtex-google-scholar) for formal sources (or a reference manager).
