1. Review the notes from today
1. Run and examine how rect.hack and max.hack in the `projects/05/` folder  of the [CPU Emulator](https://nand2tetris.github.io/web-ide/cpu) work. Make notes and answer the questions below in {index}`assemblyexplore.md`.
    ```
    1. What does rect.hack do?  
    2. What did you learn trying to figure out how it works?
    2. Write an excerpt of code in a high level compiled language that would compile into this `max.hack`. Try writing multiple different versions.
    ```
1. Use the simulator to figure out what the program `mystery.hack` that is on the notes for today does.
