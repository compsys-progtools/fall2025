1. Most real projects partly adhere and at least partly deviate from any major design philosophy or paradigm. Add a `## Unix Philosophy` section to your {index}`software.md` about how that project adheres to and deviates from the unix philosophy. Be specific, using links to specific lines of code or specific sections in the documentation that support your claims. Provide at least one example of both adhering and deviating from the philosophy and three total examples (that is 2 examples for one side and one for the other).  You can see what badge `software.md` was previously assigned in and the original instructions [on the KWL file list](https://compsys-progtools.github.io/spring2024/genindex.html).
2. create {index}`methods.md` and answer the following:

```
- which of the three methods for studying a system do you use most often when debugging? Give an example
- which do you use when you are trying to understand something new? Is it the same as when you are debugging? why or why not
- do you think the ones you use most often are consistently effective? why or why not? When do they work or not work? (for either learning new thing or debugging)
- what are you most interested in trying that might be different for either learning new things or debugging?
```
