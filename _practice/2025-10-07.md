1. Review the notes from today
1. Make a table in {index}`gitplumbingreview.md` in your KWL repo that relates the two types of git commands we have seen: plumbing and porcelain. The table should have two columns, one for each type of command (plubming and porcelain).  Each row should have one git porcelain command and at least one of the corresponding git plumbing command(s). Include two rows: `add` and `commit`.1. Review the notes from today
1. Read more details about [git internals](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects) to review what we did in class in greater detail. Make a file {index}`gitplumbingdetail.md` and create a a table or mermaid diagram that shows the relationship between at least **three** porcelain commands and their corresponding plumbing commands (generally more than one each). 
2. Create {index}`gitislike.md` and explain main git operations we have seen (add, commit, push) in your own words in a way that will either help you remember or how you would explain it to someone else at a high level. This might be analogies or explanations using other programming concepts or concepts from a hobby.
