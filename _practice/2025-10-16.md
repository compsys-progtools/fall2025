1. Review the notes from today
1. Update your KWL Chart learned column with what you've learned
2. prevent `badges.json` and `badges.yml` from being tracked by git in your kwl repo
3. write a bash script that prevents `jupyter-book` from giving warnings about files not having a heading by using the file name as a temporary title. (see the previous badge where you should have converted your repo, or do that one first, this counts as an extension on that if you have not done it)
   
Hint: Use [`sed`](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html)'s insert option and [head](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/head.1.html) as needed. 


## Explore idea

modify your script to use [a small llm from ollama](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.2) to automatically insert a sensible title by summarizing the file. **using a commercial chat interface does not qualify, but using an llm locally does**
