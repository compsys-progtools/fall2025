# About this Site

Welcome to the course website for Computer Systems and Programming Tools in Spring 2025.

::::{warning}
For fall 2025, I have changed the tool that builds this site, I *think* I fixed all the bugs, but there may still be broken links
::::

(location)=
This class meets TuTh 12:30PM - 1:45PM in Library 166 and lab on Monday 3:00PM - 4:45PM in Ballentine Hall 114. 

This website will contain the syllabus, class notes, and other reference material for the class. Links on the site can contain a lot of detail like for example, you can view the [class schedule by hovering here](#classschedule) or the [tentative lab schedule](#labschedule). 


## Navigating the Sections

The Syllabus section has logistical operations for the course broken down into sections.  You can also read straight through by starting in the first one and navigating to the next section using the arrow navigation at the end of the page.  

This site is a resource for the course.  We do not follow a text book for this course, but all notes from class are posted in the notes section, accessible on the left hand side menu, visible on large screens and in the menu on mobile.


The resources section has links and short posts that provide  more context and explanation.  Content in this section is for the most part not strictly the material that you'll be graded on, but it is often material that will help you understand and grow as a programmer and data scientist.


## Reading each page

Some pages of the syllabus and resources are also notebooks, if you want to see behind the curtain of how I manage the course information.

```{code-cell} bash
