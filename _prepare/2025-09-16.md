1. Find the glossary page for the course website, link to it in a comment. 
1. Review the terms for the next class: shell, terminal, bash, git, zsh, powershell, GitHub. Make a diagram using [mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/) to highlight how these terms relate to one another. Put this in a file called `terminal-vocab.md` on a branch linked to this issue. You might like to work with [mermaid.live](https://mermaid.live/). GitHub can [render mermaid diagrams in issues, prs, discussions,  wikis and markdown files](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams#creating-mermaid-diagrams)
