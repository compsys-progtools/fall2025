1. In {index}`fractionalbinary.md` use 8 bits to represent the following numbers by using 4 bits as usual (8,4,2,1) and the other 4 bits are 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16th:
- 1.5
- 12.75
- 7.5625
- 15.9375
1. Add to your file some notes about the limitations of representing non integer values this way. How much would using more bits help with, what limitations are not resolved by adding more bits. For example, how could you represent .1?
