**since this is posted late, you will get time for the following at the start of class**

1. **read the notes from 11/13** there is a more detailed solution to the problems we did in class
2. Trace through the [ripple carry adder](https://lodev.org/logicemu/#id=ripple_carry_adder) to see how different calculations take different amounts of time. Find up with 2 example addition problems that demonstrate how much the time can vary(one short, one long). 

*hint* use electron mode instead of immediate and it will count.  There is also a "reload" button that will reset the counter.
