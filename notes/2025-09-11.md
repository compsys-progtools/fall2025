# How can I work offline? 

:::::{important}
If you missed class, you should do all of the following and then run the experience report action and include the [evidence](#evidence-09-11) as defined below
:::::

Today we will see a more clear motivation for each thing we do and more context. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Today we will learn to work with git repositories offline, this requires understanding some about file systems and how content is organized on computers. 

We will learn:
- relative and absolute paths
- basic bash commands for navigating the file system
- authenticating to GitHub on a terminal
- how to clone a repo
- how fetch and checkout work


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
## Let's get organized 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


For class you will need to have a folder on your computer where you will keep all of your materials. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We will start using the terminal today, by getting all set up. 

+++{"lesson_part": "site"}
Open a terminal window.  I am going to use `bash` commands

:::::::{tab-set}
:::::{tab-item} MacOs
If you are on MacOs, your default shell is {term}`zsh` which is mostly the same as bash for casual use. You can switch to bash to make your output more like mine using the command `bash` if you want, but it is not required. 
:::::
:::::{tab-item} Windows-GitBash
if you are on windows, your **GitBash** terminal will be the least setup work to use `bash`
:::::
:::::{tab-item} Windows-WSL or Linux
if you have WSL (if you do not, no need to worry) you should be able to set your linux shell to `bash`
:::::
:::::::



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
:::::{margin}
::::{admonition} âš“ Glossary links
:icon: false
View the markdown of this page to see how these terms are turned into a glossary link. 
Use that as an example to submit a [community badge](#badges:process:community) to add glossary links to more terms now or in the future. 
::::
:::::

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
### Getting familiar with a terminal 

The {term}`prompt` is the part in the {term}`terminal` at the current line before  you can type, mine is 
`brownsarahm@~ $ ` 

:::::{attention}
In the notes, I remove my prompt from the excerpts, this makes it so that you can copy the blocks to use them if you are practicing, stuck, or making up and need help to get around a typo
::::::
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

### Navigating from the terminal
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

The command `pwd` **p**rint **w**orking **d**irectory

also known as the current {term}`path`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
pwd
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

My path is: 
```{code-block} console
/Users/brownsarahm
```

It outputs the {term}`absolute path` of the location that I was at. 
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

When ever we are in the terminal, we always have to be *in* a particular location within the file system, because the computer is organized as a collection of files. 



+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

::::::{margin}
::::{tip}
this symbol (`~`) is called the "tilde" pronounced till-dah
::::
::::::::

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

we start at home, which has a shortcut (`~`)


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
### Creating a folder
What you want to have is a folder for class (mine is `systems`) in a place you can find it. 

You will need a place where you can download multiple {term}`repositories <repository>` and you will need to know the relative path from one to another, so having them "close" to one another is helpful. 

(mine is in my inclass folder, I have a separate teaching folder for outside of class time, like where my draft of these notes is)

You might:
- make a CSC311 folder in your Documents folder and an inclass folder in there
- make an inclass folder in the CSC311 folder you already made
- use the CSC311 folder as your in class working space
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can **c**hange **d**irectory with `cd`

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can **m**a**k** a new **dir**ectory with `mkdir`

+++{"lesson_part": "site"}
::::{exercise}
:label: create-course-dir

Create a folder that you will use for class that meets the above criteria and move into it
::::::


::::{solution} create-course-dir
:class: dropdown
Use `cd` to move to where you want the folder, then use `mkdir` to create it, then `cd` to get there.  

Your exact location will be different than mine. 
:::::

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

I will work inside my documents folder, and then create a folder `inclass`. 

+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd Documents/inclass/
```


:::::{hint}
use <kbd>tab</kbd> to complete things, for example I typed `cd Doc` + <kbd>tab</kbd> + `inc` + <kbd>tab</kbd> to execute the cell above
:::::


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and make a folder for this class there, called `systems`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mkdir systems
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
## More navigation

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Let's again look at our current directory 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
pwd
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
/Users/brownsarahm/Documents/inclass
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
then cd into the folder I just made
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd systems/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and look at the {term}`path` agian
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
pwd
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
/Users/brownsarahm/Documents/inclass/systems
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
we can look at what is in the folder with `ls` for list
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

This folder is empty still 
```{code-block} console
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
To go back one step in the path, (one level up in the tree) we use `cd ..` 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd ..
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
`..` is a special file that points to a specific relative path, of one level up. 

it exists in every location

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can see how it worked by looking at the working directory now

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
pwd
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
/Users/brownsarahm/Documents/inclass
```

Compare this to the previous one to see what happened
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


If we give no path to `cd` it brings us to home. 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

To confirm, we look at the path again
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
pwd
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
/Users/brownsarahm
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can use `cd` with many folders at once. This is called a {term}`relative path`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd Documents/inclass/systems/
```

we can see it is relative because it does not start with `/`
+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
pw
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
-bash: pw: command not found
```
`command not found` typically means you have spelled the command wrong

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
pwd
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
/Users/brownsarahm/Documents/inclass/systems
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Relative paths can also combine multiple `..`. For example

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd ../../
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
pwd
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
/Users/brownsarahm/Documents/
```
Again, compare to the one above

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Then we will go back to the folder we want to work in for today:
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd inclass/systems/
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and confirm: 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
pwd
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
/Users/brownsarahm/Documents/inclass/systems
```


+++{"lesson_part": "site"}
## A toy repo for in class



::::::{attention}
this {term}`repo <repository>` will be for *in class* work, you will not get feedback inside of it, unless you ask, but you will answer questions in your kwl repo about what we do in this repo sometimes
::::::::

Go to prismia and find the `accept the assignment` link to create your repository. 

### Getting code from GitHub 


We have two choices to Download a repository:
1. clone to maintain a link using git
1. download zip to not have to use git, but have no link

we want option 1 beacuse we are learning git



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
### Authenticating with GitHub
There are many ways to authenticate securely with GitHub and other git clients.  We're going to use *easier* ones for today, but we'll come back to another which is a bit more secure and is a more general type of authentication.

1. ssh keys (we will do this later)
1. `gh` CLI / gitscm in GitBash through browser **today**

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
### Cloning with CLI authentication

1. enter `gh auth login` and follow the prompts (use GitHub.com, https, and authenticate in browser)
1. Get the git url from the web page for the repo ([see github docs for screenshots](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository))
2. then `git clone` and paste your URL from github 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
For me to clone mine: 

::::::{warning}
Do not copy my URL
::::::

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git clone https://github.com/compsys-progtools/gh-inclass-fa25-brownsarahm.git
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Cloning into 'gh-inclass-fa25-brownsarahm'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 5, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 5 (delta 0), reused 4 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
Receiving objects: 100% (5/5), done.
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Confirm it worked with

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
gh-inclass-fa25-brownsarahm
```
We see the new folder that matches our repo name


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



### What is in a repo?

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can enter that folder

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd gh-inclass-fa25-brownsarahm/
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


When we compare the local directory to GitHub

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


Notice that the `.github/workflows` that we see on GitHub is missing,
that is because it is *hidden*.  All file names that start with `.` are hidden.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


We can actually see the rest with the `-a` for **all** {term}`option` or {term}`flag`.  Options are how we can pass non required parameters to command line programs. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls -a
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
.	..	.git	.github
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


We also see some special "files", `.` the current location and `..` up one directory


+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

:::::::{exercise} 
:label: flag-like
Where else in programming have you seen something like a flag? 

::::{hint}
:class: dropdown

Think about a command line program or command like a function
::::
::::::::

::::::{solution} flag-like
:class: dropdown

In some programming languages, like Python, [positional arguments](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-argument)
::::::


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

`ls` can also take an explicit path as the argument to list a different folder than the current working directory. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls .git
```


+++{"lesson_part": "site"}
:::::{margin}
:::{tip}
We can use <kbd>tab</kbd> to complete once we have a unique set of characters. 

If what we have is not unique, `bash` will do nothing when you press <kbd>tab</kbd> once, but if you press it multiple times it will show you the options and put what you had typed back in the prompt for you to continue
::::
::::::
+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

we see that is not unique when we press <kbd>tab</kbd> twice
```{code-block} console
.git/    .github/ 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Then I added the `h` and pressed <kbd>tab</kbd> again to get the full path 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls .github/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
workflows
```
`

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


## How do I know what git knows? 

[`git status`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-status) is your friend. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls .github/workflows/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
create_issues.yml
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


this command compares your working directory (what you can see with `ls -a` and all subfolders except the `.git` directorty) to the current state of your `.git` directory. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


## Making a branch with GitHub and working offline


In your browser: 
1. [Create a new issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/creating-an-issue) with the title `create a readme`
1. Create a branch using the link in the development section of the right side panel. See the [github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-a-branch-for-an-issue) for how to do that. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


Then it gives you two steps to do. We are going to do them one at a time so we can see better what they each do. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


First we will update the `.git` directory without changing the working directory using [git fetch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fetch). We have to tell git fetch where to get the data from, we do that using a name of a {term}`remote`. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Here `origin` is the name of a {term}`remote` repository that we got our content from. 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git fetch origin
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
From https://github.com/compsys-progtools/gh-inclass-fa25-brownsarahm
 * [new branch]      1-add-a-readme -> origin/1-add-a-readme
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


We can look at the repo to see what has changed. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

This says nothing, because remember git status tells us the relationship between our working directory and the .git repo. 
++{"lesson_part": "main"}


Next, we switch to that branch. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git checkout 1-add-a-readme
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
branch '1-add-a-readme' set up to track 'origin/1-add-a-readme'.
Switched to a new branch '1-add-a-readme'
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and verify what happened

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch 1-add-a-readme
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/1-add-a-readme'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

`

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


## Creating a file on the terminal

The `touch` command creates an empty file. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
touch README.md
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
README.md
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git staus
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
git: 'staus' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.

The most similar command is
	status
```
::::::{attention}
Notice how `git` gives a hint
:::::::

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch 1-add-a-readme
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/1-add-a-readme'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	README.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


we will the [nano text editor](https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/latest/nano.html) to add some content  `nano` is simpler than other text editors that tend to be more popular among experts, `vim` and `emacs`.  Getting comfortable with nano will get you used to the ideas, without putting as much burden on your memory.  This will set you up to learn those later, if you need a more powerful terminal text editor. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

First, we open the nano program on the terminal.  it displays reminders of the commands at the bottom of th screen and allows you to type into the file right away. 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
nano README.md 
```

Add `# Github in class` to the file or any other content, then save and exit. 
- To save use <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + o (the `^` stands for <kbd>ctrl</kbd>)
- it will prompt you to enter or confirm the file name press <kbd>enter</kbd>/ <kbd>return</kbd> to keep the same file name
- To exit use <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + x



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

This is very similar to when we checked after creating the file before, but, notice a few things are different.  
- the first line tells us the branch but does not compare to origin. (this branch does not have a linked branch on GitHub)
- thefile is listed as "not staged" instead of untracked
- it gives us the choice to add it to then commit OR to restore it to undo the changes



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We will add it to stage. 

`.` is a special file that stands in for everything in the current directory here. 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git add .
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch 1-add-a-readme
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/1-add-a-readme'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   README.md

```
Notice that now the file is `to be comitted` intead of `untracked`

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
::::::::::{important}
a {term}`commit message` is **required** if you do not type on and run `git commit` it will open `vim` or `vi`. To get out of those programs, use <kbd>esc<kbd> to get into command mode then type `:wq` for write and quit
:::::::::::::

We will make a commit using the `-m` {term}`option` to add the message directly.  We will include `closes #1`, to set up what we will do next class
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git commit -m 'create a readme closes #1'
```

## Questions After Today's Class 

### What exactly does Git checkout do?

`git checkout` as we used it today switched branches and set our current working directory to match the new branch. 

[see docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout)

We will learn more about *how* it works soon, but at a high level it changes the current branch. 

### Are there other advantages for using Git other than being able to work offline?

`git` is a version control system it keeps track of your different changes. 

When you use GitHub, you also use `git`, it runs on their servers; in fact `git` is designed for this.  You would use it locally even if you were working in a cloud programming environment, but it would be local to the virtual machine instead of your local computer. 

### how you upload files from your local computer to github?

We will do that Tuesday!


### Is there a way to change directories if the folder name contains a space?

Yes, if it is unique, tab complete will fill in the necessary <wiki:Escape_character> for you. If not, you will need to know the correct character. 


### what will we use these for in the real world 

You will use the `git` commands all the time to track your code. These basic bash commands are also used a lot to make and move files or to inspect things. It is still common in HPC systems to not provide a robust visual interface, only a terminal because the visual interface takes up a lot of resources and it not really required. 

Eventually, once you learn these once, it is also *a lot* faster to do basic file things with scripts and the terminal. 

:::::{note}
If you complete your experience badge after I start answering them for the notes, your question will not get answered here. 

You can create an issue on the course website to get an answer
