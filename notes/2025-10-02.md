# How do programmers communicate about code? 

+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

:::::::::{attention}
If you are making up class be sure to answer the boxes like the following in your experience report. 

If you are reviewing the material, be sure you can think of answers to these. 

:::::{exercise} example
Example question to answer
:::::::
::::::::::::

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Today we are going to pick up from where we left off talking about the conventional commits. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

That is a core example of the types of detailed communication we do in programming that is embedded into the work. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Why Documentation

Today we will talk about documentation, there are several reasons this is important: 
- **using** official documentation is the best way to get better at the tools
- understanding how documentation is designed and built will help you use it better
- **writing** and  **maintaining** documentation is really important part of working on a team
- even if you use an LLM to help improve the writing, a human must verify the actual facts
- documentation building tools are a type of developer tool (and these are generally good software design)
- documentation building tools can help produce other types of writing in more developer-centric ways (nice automation of tedious things, etc)
  



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Design is best learned from examples. Some of the best examples of software *design* come from developer tools. 

- [source (js version)](https://third-bit.com/sdxjs/)
- [source (python version)](https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/)






+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

In particular documentation tools are really good examples of: 
- pattern matching
- modularity and abstraction
- automation
- the build process beyond compiling



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"outcomes"}

By the end of today's class you will be able to:
- describe different types of documentation
- find different information in a code repo
- generate documentation as html 
- create a repo locally and push to GitHub

Plus we will reinforce things we have already seen: 
- ignoring content from a repo
- paths
- good file naming

## What is documentation 


We looked at a [documentation types table](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10606-018-9333-1/tables/1) from  an article [ethnography of documentation data science](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10606-018-9333-1)


+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

:::::{exercise}
Read the table and answer the following questions in your experience badge. 
1. Which have you used before?
1. Which have you contributed to before? 
1. what kinds did you review in the prepare work? 
::::::::


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Why is documentation so important?

we should probably spend more time on it

![differenc ein time spent vs should](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10606-018-9333-1/MediaObjects/10606_2018_9333_Fig4_HTML.png?as=webp)

[source](https://bids.berkeley.edu/news/most-developers-think-we-should-spend-more-time-documentation)




+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## So, *how* do we do it? 

Different types of documentation live in different places and we use tools to maintain them. 

As developers, we rely on code to do things that are easy for computers and hard for people. 


+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

You can read a list of [documentation tools](https://docathon.github.io/docathon/pages/resources.html#documentation-tools) built by the researchers at UC Berkeley who hosted a docathon, week long hackathon to help people get better at building documentation for the tools they used and built.  

The site shows different tools for many different languages and a short description of many of the top tools. 

+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

There is even a whole community and site just for documentation: [write the docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/)



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Jupyterbook 

We're going to use [Jupyterbook v1](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html). Jupyterber v1 wraps a tool called [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and uses {term}`myst` {term}`markdown` instead of {term}`reStructuredText`. The project authors [note in the documenation](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/explain/sphinx.html) that it "can be thought of as an *opinionated distribution of Sphinx*". 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

[sphinx is a very popular tool](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/examples.html) so knowing how it works is a general advantage.  reStructuredText is not hard to learn, but I did not want to spend time on that, so we're using markdown to keep it simple, and to demonstrate that these tools are extensible. 

Even the [linux kernel uses sphinx](https://lwn.net/Articles/705224/) and here is [why](https://lwn.net/Articles/692704/) and [how it works](https://lwn.net/Articles/692705/)

::::::::::{margin}

(prevsite)=
:::::::{note}

In past semesters, I used jupyterbook for the course website. See examples:
- [fall 2024](https://compsys-progtools.github.io/fall2025/)
- [spring 2022](https://introcompsys.github.io/spring2022/)

This website is built with [mystmd](https://mystmd.org/guide/installing) which will be the basis for [jupyterbook 2.0](https://next.jupyterbook.org/). 

::::::::

::::::::::

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

navigate to your  folder for this course (mine is `inclass/systems`)

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can confirm that `jupyter-book` is installed by checking the version. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
jupyter-book --version
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Jupyter Book      : 1.0.4.post1
External ToC      : 1.0.1
MyST-Parser       : 3.0.1
MyST-NB           : 1.3.0
Sphinx Book Theme : 1.1.4
Jupyter-Cache     : 1.0.1
NbClient          : 0.10.2

```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We will run a command to create a jupyterbook from a template:

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
jupyter-book create tiny-book
```


the command has 3 parts: 
- `jupyter-book` is a {term}`program` 
- `create` is a {term}`command`[^subcmd] 
- `tiny-book` is an {term}`argument` 

[^subcmd]: sometimes commands within a program are called subcommands 

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

===============================================================================

Your book template can be found at

    tiny-book/

===============================================================================

```

+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

::::::::::{exercise} 
:label: structure
Give an example of another command we have done that has these 3 parts (program, (sub)command[subcmd^], argument)

:::::::{solution} structure
:class:dropdown
One example is `git add .`

- `git` is a {term}`program`
- `add` is a {term}`command`
- `.` is a path, and an {term}`argument`

::::{attention}
anything with a `-` is an {term}`option`
:::::
:::::::::

::::::::::::


+++{"lesson_part": "site"}
:::::::::{margin}
::::::{attention}
Making sure you know these vocab terms precisely is important for talking with other developers and especially interviews
::::::::
::::::::::::




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
we can verify the output by looking 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
fall25-kwl-brownsarahm		tiny-book
gh-inclass-fa25-brownsarahm
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

because the name is an argument or input, you can make it with any name: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
jupyter-book create example
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

===============================================================================

Your book template can be found at

    example/

===============================================================================

```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Each one makes a directory, we can see by listing
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
example				gh-inclass-fa25-brownsarahm
fall25-kwl-brownsarahm		tiny-book
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
And we can delete the second one since we do not actually want it. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
rm example/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
rm: example/: is a directory
```

we get an error because it is not well defined to delete a directory, and potentially risky, so `rm` is written to throw an error

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


Instead, we have to tell it two additional things: 
- to delete recusively `r`
- to force it to do something risky with `f`
  
*note* we can stack single character options together with a single `-`
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
rm -rf example/
```

::::::::{warning}
In most of bash the `-f` is reserved for potentially dangerous things, so use it with care and take time to verify that it is really what you want to do
::::::::::::::


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

then we verify that it worked

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
fall25-kwl-brownsarahm		tiny-book
gh-inclass-fa25-brownsarahm
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Now, let's move inside the new folder 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd tiny-book/
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and look at what is there
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls -a
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
_config.yml		intro.md		notebooks.ipynb
_toc.yml		logo.png		references.bib
.			markdown-notebooks.md	requirements.txt
..			markdown.md
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


## Starting a git repo locally

We made this folder, but we have not used any git operations on it yet, it is actually not a git repo, which we *could* tell from the output above, but let's use git to inspect and get another hint. 
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can try `git status`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
```


This tells us the `.git` directory is missing form the current path and all parent directories. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

To make it a git repo we use `git init` with the path we want to initialize, which currently is `.`



```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git init .
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
hint: Using 'master' as the name for the initial branch. This default branch name
hint: is subject to change. To configure the initial branch name to use in all
hint: of your new repositories, which will suppress this warning, call:

hint:
hint: Names commonly chosen instead of 'master' are 'main', 'trunk' and
hint: 'development'. The just-created branch can be renamed via this command:

```
::::::::{margin}
(nomaster)=
:::::{attention}
### Retiring racist language
Historically the default branch was called master.

- [derived from a master/slave analogy](https://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2019-May/msg00066.html) which is not even how git works, but was adopted terminology from other projects
- [GitHub no longer does](https://github.com/github/renaming)
- [the broader community is changing as well](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/)
- [git allows you to make your default not be master](https://lore.kernel.org/git/pull.656.v4.git.1593009996.gitgitgadget@gmail.com/)
- [literally the person who chose the names "master" and "origin" regrets that choice](https://twitter.com/xpasky/status/1271477451756056577) the name main is a more accurate and not harmful term and the current convention.  
- this is one of a long list of terms [ACM recommends not using](https://www.acm.org/diversity-inclusion/words-matter)
:::::
::::::::

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We want to use up to date, inclusive terminology, and we have already been using main for the default branch so far so let's do that again: 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git branch -m main
```
+++{"lesson_part": "site"}
::::::{important}
This is also a good reminder that branch names are just names of variables we choose, we can make them whatever we want, `git` does not care what they are.  We need branch names because otherwise we would have to keep track of commit hashes ourselves, but we can name them whatever we want. 
::::::::::


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and check in with git now
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

:::::{margin}

Notice:
- there are no previous commits
- all of the files are untracked
::::

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We have to add separately because the files are **untracked** we cannot use the `-a` option on commit
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git add . 
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and then we will commit with a simple message
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git commit -m 'jupyter book template'
```

### Structure of a Jupyter book


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We will explore the output by looking at the files

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
_config.yml		logo.png		notebooks.ipynb
_toc.yml		markdown-notebooks.md	references.bib
intro.md		markdown.md		requirements.txt
```


A jupyter book has two required files (`_config.yml` and `_toc.yml`), some for content, and some helpers that are common but not required. 

- [config defaults](https://jupyterbook.org/customize/config.html#configuration-defaults)
- [toc file formatting rules](https://jupyterbook.org/structure/toc.html#structure-of-a-book)
- the `*.md` files are content
- the `.bib` file is bibiolography information
- The other files are optional, but common. [Requirements.txt](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files) is the format for pip to install python depndencies. There are different standards in other languages for how


+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

```{note}
the extention (`.yml`) is [yaml](https://yaml.org/), which stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language". It consists of key, value pairs and is deigned to be a human-friendly way to encode data for use in any programming language.
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Dev tools mean we do not have to write bibliographies manually

bibliographies are generated with [bibtex](http://www.bibtex.org/) which takes structured information from the references in a [bibtex file](http://www.bibtex.org/Format/) with help from [sphinxcontrib-bibtex](https://sphinxcontrib-bibtex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

For general reference, reference managers like [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and [mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) can track all of your sources and output the references in bibtex format that you can use anywhere or sync with tools like MS Word or Google Docs. 

+++{"lesson_part": "site"}
::::{tip}
You can use these in a build or explore badge
:::::



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat _config.yml 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

The configuration file, tells jupyter-book basic iformation about the book, it provides all of the settings that jupyterbook and sphinx need to render the content as whatever output format we want.

If you wanted to change the styling with sphinx you can use built in
[themes](https://sphinx-themes.org/) which tell sphinx to put different
files in the `_static` folder when it builds your site, but you don't have to change any of your content!  If you like working on front end things (which is great! it's just not alwasy the goal) you can even
build [your own theme](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/development/theming.html) that can work with sphinx.

## Handling Built files

The built site files are compeltey redundant, content wise, to the original markdown files. 

We do not want to keep track of changes for the built files since they are generated from the source files. It's redundant and makes it less clear where someone should update content. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	_build/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Git helps us with this with the .gitignore

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo "_build" >> .gitignore
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	.gitignore

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
only the gitingore file itself is listed! just as we want. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
now that's the only new file as far as git is concerned, so we will track this, 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git add .
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and finally commit



```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git commit -m 'ignore build'
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
[main 628eac6] ignore build
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 .gitignore
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and check the status againg
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}


## How do I push a repo that I made locally to GitHub?
Right now, we do not have any remotes, so if we try to push it will fail. Next we will see how to fix that. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

First let's confirm 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git push
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
fatal: No configured push destination.
Either specify the URL from the command-line or configure a remote repository using

    git remote add <name> <url>

and then push using the remote name

    git push <name>

```

and it tells us how to fix it.  This is why inspection is so powerful in 
developer tools, that is where we developers give one another hints. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Right now, we do not have any remotes
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git remote
```

For today, we will [create a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo)  shared with me, by creating an empty repo owned by the course organization, named `tiny-book-GHUSERNAME` with `GHUSERNAME` replaced with your own username. 



That default page for an empty repo if you do not initiate it with any files will give you the instructions for what remote to add.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Now we add the remote (by copying from the instructions)
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git remote add origin https://github.com/compsys-progtools/tiny-book-brownsarahm1.git
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
push still does not quite work
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git push
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
fatal: The current branch main has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin main

To have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking
upstream, see 'push.autoSetupRemote' in 'git help config'.

```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
form the github instructions, we know that `-u` is the short version of `--set-upstream`: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git push -u origin main
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Enumerating objects: 14, done.
Counting objects: 100% (14/14), done.
Delta compression using up to 16 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (12/12), done.

 * [new branch]      main -> main
branch 'main' set up to track 'origin/main'.
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Now we can see what it changed

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git remote
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
origin
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and review the config: 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat .git/config 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = true
	bare = false
	logallrefupdates = true
	ignorecase = true
	precomposeunicode = true

	url = https://github.com/compsys-progtools/tiny-book-brownsarahm1.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[branch "main"]
	remote = origin

## Experience Report Evidence

Tiny book repo should exist. Append your terminal output or this repo's git log  to your experience report. 

## Questions After Today's Class 

:::::{note}
I have added some questions from previous semesters that were really good. 
::::::

### How does bibtex generate bibliographies?

the bibtex file contains all of the information and then another build tool like jupyterbook, latex compiler, or mystmd processes it to produce the bibliography. 

### how does jupyter-book build documentation?

It parses the markdown to generate the html of the content and combines it with templates to make the complete website.  Sphinx can also process the docstrings or other attributes in your code to generate documenation pages of the API or a CLI. 

### What are the downsides of jupyter-book?

It is focused on python and there are other documentation engines that have better support for other langauges.  

It provides not quite as good of a reading experience as mystmd. To see this compare the features in the notes from this semester to [past semesters](#prevsite). 

### If I delete a required folder in tiny-book, what would happen to the website?

There are no required folders, but if the required files are missing you get an error. 

### How much will we be using jupyter books in the class?

I recommend using them for build badges and they're in today's practice badge to conver your kwl repo. 

###  Is there a cheatsheet for jupyter-book or just the documentation?

The documentation's `RESOURCES` section has a [cheatsheet](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/reference/cheatsheet.html) for Myst-Markdown and a [configuration reference](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/customize/config.html) which are what I use a lot. 


### can i use jupyter-book outside bash?

It is only a command line tool, but it is not {term}`shell` specific

### Why should the `_build/` folder be ignored with `.gitignore`, and what problem could happen if you don’t?

Because it is not needed, we can re-generate it on demand.  

If you don't and then have a merge conflict, you would have twice as many (at least) merge conflicts to solve manually. 

Also, it would make the repo take up a lot more space for no benefit. 


### What sorts of automation can be made between a repsitory and a Jupyter Book created website?

You can make a github action to automatically build the website and deploy it, see the [previous semsters](#prevsite) repositories and even this site's repo has a gh action to deploy, but it is myst instead of jupyterbook. 


### What is the difference between Jupyter Book, Lab, and Notebook?

Jupyter Notebook is a single stream of computational analysis. Jupyter Lab is a more IDE like interface for doing compuational analyses. Both are part of [project jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and [on GitHub](https://github.com/jupyter)

[Jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) is for publishing book like documents as websites and to other forms designed to be compatible with jupyter notebooks, but is a part of a separate [executable books](https://github.com/executablebooks) project.  It is specialized for cases where there is computation in the code.  See [their gallery]() for examples.  I use it for [CSC310 that has code and plots in the notes](https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall22/notes/2022-09-21.html)

### Is documentation a requirement when creating a programming language?

If you want people to be able to use your language then pretty much. That said, not all languages are open source and have easily accessbile, official documentation.  [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/), [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html), [Asteroid](https://asteroid-lang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (developed here at URI), [Ruby](https://ruby-doc.org/) and [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/) among many others do. On the other hand the C++ language does not have any official documentation. There is a [C++ standard](https://isocpp.org/std/the-standard) that you can purchase, but no official documentation. 

### Can jupyterbook convert other languages to html or only python?

It doesn't convert plain python to html, it can run jupyter notebooks.  Jupyter notebooks can run [many different](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels) [kernels](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/glossary.html#term-kernel). [Jupyter-book is an opinionated distribution](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/explain/sphinx.html#:~:text=opinionated%20distribution%20of%20Sphinx) of  [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) which can also be used to document other languages like [C++](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/clear-functional-c-documentation-with-sphinx-breathe-doxygen-cmake/)



### Should I use Jupyterbook for creating websites showcasing some of my programming projects?

You totally can. You could also use sphinx which is more customizable. A [sphinx gallery](https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/index.html) might be of interest. 

```{admonition} Build Badge
:class: anchor

You could build a profile website using a tool like this or other jamstack tool that showcases projects for a build badge. 
```

### What happends to files in .gitignore once the repo is pushed?

Absolutely nothing. They exist in your working directory but they are not in the `.git` directory.  These files are not tracked by git locally and not backed up by being copied to a server. 

### does jupyterbook have a hosting service or should we use something else like github pages?

Jupyterbook only provides the builder, but they do provide instructions [for hosting with mulitple services](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/publish/web.html).
