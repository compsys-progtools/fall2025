# More orientation

Today we will: 
- continue getting familiar with the structure of GitHub
- clarify more how the course will flow
- practice with new vocabulary

*Last class was a lot of new information, today we will reinforce that mostly, and add only a little*+++

:::::{exercise} Warm up
1. Navigate to your KWL repo 
2. Find the issues tab
3. Open the pepare issue for today and discuss the questions with your classmates at your table
:::::

*hint: my KWL repo URL is: `https://github.com/compsys-progtools/fall25-kwl-brownsarahm`


## How will we learn


> "just play with it"

- common attitude in CS
- not optimal for learning

**my goal is to teach you to get better at learning in that way, because it is what employers will expect you to be able to do**

To do this:
- set up opportunities for you to *do* the things that give you the opportunity
- highlight important facts about what just happened
- ask you questions to examine what just happened


This is why attendance/participation is a big part of your grade. 

Experience badges are evidence of having learned



### Programming is Collaborative



There are two very common types of collaboration:
- code review (working independently and then reviewing)
- pair programming (sitting together and discussing while writing)


We are going to build your skill in the *code review* model.  This means you need to collaborate, but collaboration in school tends to be more stressful than it needs to. If students have different goals or motivation levels it can create conflict.  So there will be some chances for collaboration where people can show up at the level they want without impacting others.  

You can also do build badges collaboratively, for a closer collaboration, but those are your choice.


## GitHub Actions Tab  

GitHub allows us to run scripts within our repos, the feature is called GitHub Actions and the individual items are called workflows.

:::::{exercise}
1. Run the `Create About` action
1. Edit and fill in that file, request a review from `@brownsarahm`
