# What *is* a commit?


:::{attention}
There were some reminders on prismia at the start of class, if you missed class, be sure to read those. 
:::


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}


## Defining terms



A commit is the most important unit of git. Later we will talk about what git as a whole is in more detail, but understanding a commit is essential to understanding how to fix things using git. 



+++{"lesson_part":"main"}



In CS we often have multiple, overlapping definitions for a term depending on our goal. 

In intro classes, we try really hard to only use one definition for each term to let you focus. 

Now we need to contend with multiple definitions


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

(commit:defs:list)=
These definitons could be based on 
- what it [conceptually](#def:commit:conceptual) represents
- its [role](#def:commit:role) in a larger system
- what its [parts](#commitparts:content) are
- how it is [implemented](#def:commit:implementation)


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}



for a commit, today, we are going to go through all of these, with lighter treatment on the implementation for today, and more detail later. 


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}


(def:commit:conceptual)=
## Conceptually, a commit is a snapshot

::::::{margin}

```{figure} https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/snapshots.png
:label: snapshot
:alt: storing data as snapshots over time

git takes a full *snapshot* of the repo at each commit.  
```


Under the hood, it only makes an additional copy of files that have changed because it uses the same technique to store each snapshot, so any files that have not changed, do not create new files inside of git. 

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}


(def:commit:role)=
## A commit's role is central to git

a commit is the basic unit of what git manages

All other git things are defined relative to commits


- branches are pointers to commits that move
- tags are pointers to commits that do not move
- trees are how file path/organization information is stored for a commit
- blobs are how files contents are stored when a commit is made


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}


(def:commit:parts)=
## Parts of a commit

We will learn about the structure of a commit by inspecting it. 


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
First we will go back to our `gh-inclass` repo

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]

but we know commits are supposed to represent some content and we have no information about that in this view


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
### Seeing the full commit content

we can view individual commits with `git cat-file` and at least 4 
characters of the hash or enough to be unique.  We will try 4 characters 
and I will use the commit we inspected above, with full hash  `e899a0e7ad5a9626a6d5c6b0fd96a410bd42b710`

`git cat-file` has  different modes and one **must** be specified for it to work:
- `-p` for pretty print
- `-t` to return the type

We'll use `-p` here: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -p e899
```

(def:commit:implementation)=
## Commits are implemented as files 

commits are stored in the `.git` directory as files.  git itself *is* a file system, or a way of storing information.  


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}


Everything the git program uses is stored in the `.git` directory, you can think of that like all of the variables the program would need if it ran all the time.

Most of the content is in the `objects` folder, git {term}`objects <object>` are the items that get stores.

We see a lot more folders here than we had commits.  This is because there are multiple types of {term}`objects <object>` that all create entries in this {term}`object database`


+++{"lesson_part":"site"}
There are 3 main types:

## Losing stuff in git is hard

Imagine you had several commits including some on a new branch

```{figure} ../img/not_lost.png
:label: notlost
:alt: a conceptual depiction of 3 commits with 1 tree each and blobs for some files with a main branch and an unnamed second branch

in this example we have 3 commits: A, B, C and each has a tree and there are some blob objects. The arrows are the things we can trace through, where there are pointers from one object to another.
```

Now conisder that you switched back to the main branch and then deleted the new branch without merging those commits.  

```
git checkout main
git branch -d new
```

so our situation is like this

```{figure} ../img/not_lost_deleted.png
:label: notlost_deleted
:alt: same as above with the new branch dashed to indicate deleted

now the new branch is deleted
```

Normally when we get a branch with `git checkout` the following happens:
1. changing the head pointer to point to that branch
1. going to the commit the branch points to
1. reading the tree in the commit
1. for each blob/tree in the that tree, create the file based on the name in the tree and the conent in the blob


Now we have no way to access commit C or the chances to files f1 and f2, because we have no pointer to it.  The contente is still there though!

We could recover it manually by: 
1. logging the current commit hash (B)
1. goign to its tree and logging the hash for tB
1. going to the blob objects from that tree and logging each of those (f3.0, f2.1, f1.0)
1. going the commit before commit (from B to A)
1. logging the hash of that commit (A)
1. goign to its tree and logging the hash for tA
1. going to the blob objects from that tree and logging each of those (f2.0, f1.0)
1. making a list of all of the hashes from `.git/objects`
1. finding which hashes are there but on on our list so far (C,tC, f2.3, f1.2)
1. checking each of those for which is a commit
1. setting a branch `new_fixed` to that hash (C)

## Tracing the commit history 

We can trace in a real repo  by first looking at the `HEAD` pointer


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat .git/HEAD 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
ref: refs/heads/organization
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
that points to the branch, which is a file so we can look at that too

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat .git/refs/heads/organization 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
e899a0e7ad5a9626a6d5c6b0fd96a410bd42b710
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

then we look at that commit


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -p e899
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

```




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

then its parent

```{code-cell} bash

git cat-file -p 285dd
```

```{code-block} console

and we could continue back






## Commit messages are essential 


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}



A git commit message must exist and is *always* for people, but can also be for machines. 


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}



the [conventional commits standard](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is a format of commits

if you use this, then you can use automated tools to generate a full change log when you release code

## A tip in code spaces

[Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) are a virutal machine that you can use VSCode on in browser.  You only have VSCode access to this system, but VSCode with the terminal is a lot of power. 


first check the status
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch organization
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
but it's not pushed so we do that

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git push
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
fatal: The current branch organization has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin organization

To have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking
upstream, see 'push.autoSetupRemote' in 'git help config'.

```

[we have seen this before](#set-upstream)

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
so we do what git suggests

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git push --set-upstream origin organization
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Then move to browser

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gh repo view --web
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Opening https://github.com/compsys-progtools/gh-inclass-fa25-brownsarahm in your browser.
```


1. Navigate to your github inclass repo on Github.com
2. Use the link in the README or the green code button to open a new codespace on main. 

when your codespace is open, share its name (first part of the url 2 words)



If VSCode is new to you, use their documentation of the [VSCode interface](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface) to get oriented to the different parts of the screen.

## Experience Report Evidence


redirect your `history` to a file `log-2024-02-08.txt` and include it with your experience report.

## Questions After Today's Class 

### What are gonna be our applications of tracing hashes? 

This was mostly a learning experience, having this *understanding* makes the more complex git commands make sense.  You generally will not do it yourself, unless you were contributing to git. 

I think it's easier to remember long term that this is how git works if you hve actually gone through it than just seeing for example a slide saying thats what it does. 

### Is using rf safe as long is its not recursively deleting?

`rm` can be used safely on specific files for sure

`rm -rf` can even be used if you know that the folder is not needed

`rm -rf ./~` is proably never what you want. 

![a meme about an AI offering to run `rm -rf ~`](../img/llm_meme.jpeg)

### How can I check the type of a git object?

`git cat-file -t <hash>` or see the [examples above](#checktype)

### Is it possible to accidentally delete commits?

It is possible to delete them, but accidentally is hard to define.  

If you are using normal git commands like add, commit, etc then no. 

To delete one you have to manually edit in the `.git` directory or delete that whole folder for a repo that has not been pushed to any {term}`remote`


### Besides the Conventional Commit Standard, what else can be used to better format commits?

This is a good [explore badge](badges:process:explore) topic
