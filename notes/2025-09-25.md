## Discussion


- share your responses to the work in the prep work for today's topic
- discuss any similiarities or differences
- if any, send back questions you have
- if any, send points you want to share to the whole class



+++{"lesson_part": "prismia","type":"formative"}


How did the  processes, decisions, and practices that people at your table brought up compare to what you thought of?

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
## Design


In CS we tend to be more implicit about design, but that makes it hard to learn and keep track of. 

Today's goal is to be more explicit, disucssing some principles and seeing how you have already interacted wit them. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



Today we're going to do a bit more practical stuff, but we are also going to start to get into the philosophy of how things are organized.  

Understanding the context and principles will help you:
- remember how to do things 
- form reliable hypotheses about how to fix problems you have not seen before
- help you understand when you should do things as they have always been done and when you should challenge and change things.  




+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Why should we study design? 


- it is easy to get distracted by implementation, syntax, algorithms
- but the core *principles* of design organize ideas into simpler rules





+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Why are we studying developer tools? 

> The best way to learn design is to study examples [Schon1984, Petre2016], and some of the best examples of software design come from the tools programmers use in their own work. 

[Software design by example](https://third-bit.com/sdxjs/)





+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

*note*

- we will talk about some history in this course
- I will not take a "great men of history" approach

This is because: 
- I think that history is important context for making decisions
- Many of these "great men" are actually, in many ways, Not Great^TM 
- It *is* important to remember that all of this work was done by *people* 
- all people are imperfect
- when people are deeply influential, ignoring their role in history is not effective, we cannot undo what they did
- we do not have to admire them or even say their names to acknowledge the work
- computing technology has been used in Very Bad ways and in Definitely Good ways

## Unix Philosophy

sources:
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)
- [a free book](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html)

- composability over monolithic design 
- social conventions 


The tenets: 

1. Make it easy to write, test, and run programs.
1. Interactive use instead of batch processing.
1. Economy and elegance of design due to size constraints ("salvation through suffering").
1. Self-supporting system: all Unix software is maintained under Unix.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

For better or [worse](http://www.ceri.memphis.edu/people/smalley/ESCI7205_misc_files/The_truth_about_Unix_cleaned.pdf) unix philosophy is dominant, so understanding it is valuable. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

This critique is written that unix is not a good system for  "normal folks" not in its effectiveness as a context for *developers* which is where *nix (unix, linux) systems remain popular. 


context:  
_"normal folks" is the author's term; my guess is that it is attempting to describe a typical, nondeveloper computer user_
_terminology to refer to people has changed a lot over time; when we study concepts from primary sources, we have to interpret the document through the lens of what was normal at the time the document was written, not to excuse bad behavior but to not be distracted and see what is there_

```

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]

cat .github/workflows/getassignment.yml 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

#  You should keep the prepare, because they are required for experience badges 
#     You may choose to get only the review or only the practice (and change this any time) 
# added comment to fix
```

A lot of this is familiar, but we are focused today on the three highlighed lines 


Here we see a few key things: 
- on the last line it uses a pipe `|` to connect a command `sysgetassignment` to the `gh issue create` command. 
- the `gh issue create` command uses the `--body-file` option with a value  `-`; this uses std in, but since this is to the right of the pipe, it puts the output of the first command into this option
- the 2nd to last line creates a variable (we will learn this more later) and the last line uses that variable
- the `Install Utils` step, installs some custom code.

We know that this action is what is used to create badge issues, so this custom code must be what gets information from the course website to get the assignments and prepare them for your badge issues.

Let's try the one we saw in the action
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cspt getassignment --type prepare
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
404: Not Found
```


With default settings, it says 404.  

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


We know that it goes online.  So, for example, if you turn your wifi off and then try it again, you will get a different error. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

To learn more about this, lets use the `--help` option.  
A lot of CLI tools have this option.  In this program, that I made, 
the Python library `click` that I used to make this, provides the `help` option automatically to show the documentation or lets me as the developer add help text to options. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cspt getassignment --help
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Usage: cspt getassignment [OPTIONS]

  get the assignment text formatted

Options:
  --type TEXT  type can be {prepare, review, or practice}; default prepare
  --date TEXT  date should be YYYY-MM-DD of the tasks you want; default most
               recently posted
  --help       Show this message and exit.
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now we can see that it can take some options.  

If we do not provide a date, I can tell you (and I should add to the documentation), it uses today's date.  Since we ran this on a day with class, before the badges were posted, the file it looked for did not exist, so we got 404. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can use the options to get the last posted prepare work
```{code-cell} bash

cspt getassignment --type prepare --date 2024-09-26
```

We can change which of those is a default

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gh repo set-default origin
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
expected the "[HOST/]OWNER/REPO" format, got "origin"
```
I forgot the format and tried to use the short name, `origin` when `gh` requires it tobe in `owner/repo` format, but this error is informative, so we know what to do: 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


````{important}
Do this step!! It will fix some of your errors
```

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gh repo set-default compsys-progtools/fall24-brownsarahm
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
✓ Set compsys-progtools/fall24-brownsarahm as the default repository for the current directory
```


## Hack the course

>build and explore ideas 

Develop new command line tools, github actions, VS Code (or other IDE) extensions, visual aids, etc
that help future students in the course.  This is a way for you to demonstrate your learning and 
contribute to open source repos that you can then link to on a portfolio website or resume. 

You can participate in this at different levels (or multiple):
- build: writing, documenting at the API level, and configuring major pieces (can be collaborative)
- explore: writing example/tutorial style docs that another student (or team) build (mostly solo; open to justification for collab)
- explore: adding summary/visuals to the notes
- community: (test option): testing other students contributions and making descriptive issues or writing short reviews (~3-5 sentenccs); must not be spammy
- community: (review option): reviewing PRs submitted by a classmate (can be within a collaborative build, but must be not your own code) a single PR can have multiple reivews if sensible and not duplicative; no spam
- community: (contribution) add a glossary term to this site

## Questions After Today's Class 

### Is there anything you can do in Github that you can't do locally?

View PRs linked to issues easily is one example.  It's not a lot though


### What should I do for prepare work?

[see instructions](prepare-experience-process)

### What is the `cspt` in get an assignment and what exactly is the `getassignment` command doing?

[see its docs](https://compsys-progtools.github.io/courseutils/cli.html#cspt-getassignment) or [source](https://github.com/compsys-progtools/courseutils/blob/main/cspt/cli.py#L55)

### Why did we type in the codepsace terminal and not on Bash?

the terminal in the codespace is `bash` on linux, where you all have *exactly* the same specs. 

GitBash, the windows terminal program that allows you to use `bash` and `git` commands has
and issue with [mintty]() that you probably have to reinstall it to make `gh` work there, but
the GitHub Codespace comes with `gh` installed. 

### Why did we use the pip install command?

`pip` is the package manager for python. `pip install` installs a package. We installed from the
[source repo]([](https://github.com/compsys-progtools/courseutils))

### What are some examples of dev tools that we can use today 

All the ones we use each class, every IDE you use, etc. 

### When should I use `--help` option?


Whenever you do not know the usage of a command. Not all programs provide it, but many modern ones do. 
Worst case it gives an error.
