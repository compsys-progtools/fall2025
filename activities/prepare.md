# Prepare Work




These tasks are usually **not** based on material that we have already seen in class.  Instead, they are to have you start thinking about the topic that we are *about* to cover before we discuss it in class. Prepare tasks are typically in one of the following forms: 

1. **refreshing your memory** of related concepts that you should have learned in a previous course (like pointers from 211).  Getting whatever you know about the topic fresh in your mind in advance of class helps your brain get ready to learn the new material more easily; brains learn by making connections. 
1. **brainstorm** something that we will use in class time, so that you are not put on the spot and do not get stuck thinking of an example. These will be things that you *could* probably do on the fly, but I give them in advance so that people have extra time if they need it. 
1. **install or download** required software or files so that you can engage in the class.  If wifi in class was always fast this wouldn't be necessary but sometimes we overload the wifi in class. 
1. **preview new material** for a few topics, you will be asked to read some things before class so that we can discuss them in class. This might be documentation of a tool, an overview of an idea or some survey results where I want you each to think about what is interesting to you. 


When the tasks include questions, the correct answer is not as important for these activities as it is to do them **before class**.  We will build on these ideas in class. These are evaluated on completion only[^cmplt] and included in your experience badge. We may ask you questions or leave comments if appropriate, in that event you should reply and then we will approve. 
These questions will typically be so that we can understand and help you, the goal is to keep an open conversation, not to make you revise the work. 


[^cmplt]: you will get full credit as long as all of the things are *done in good faith* even if not correct. However if it looks like you tried to outsource (eg to LLM) or plagiarize a solution, you will not earn credit for that.
