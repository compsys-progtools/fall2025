# Practice Badges

<!-- :::{note}
these are listed by the date they were *posted*
::: -->

Practice badges are a chance to first review the basics and then try new dimensions of the concepts that we cover in class. 
After each class, you will need to review the day's material. This includes reviewing prismia chat to see any questions you got wrong and reading the notes. The practice badge will also ask you to apply
the day's material in a similar, but distinct way. They represent the minimum bar for B-level understanding.  


:::: warning

Badges will be posted as issues and instructions will be here as well.
